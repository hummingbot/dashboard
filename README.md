# Hummingbot Dashboards

Dashboard that helps you analyze the performance of a running Hummingbot instance

### ðŸ§™ XE Token Analyzer

Dashboard that helps you visualize the bid-ask spread and volume of different tokens across the crypto exchange landscape. 

This app is most helpful for Hummingbot users running the [Cross-Exchange Market Making](https://hummingbot.org/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/) and [Arbitrage](https://hummingbot.org/strategies/arbitrage/) strategies.
