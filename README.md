# Hummingbot Dashboard

Hummingbot Dashboard is an open-source application designed to assist in the creation, backtesting, and optimization of a wide variety of algorithmic trading strategies. Once refined, these strategies can be deployed as [Hummingbot](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) instances in live trading modes, providing a seamless transition from strategy formulation to actual trading execution.

## Features

- **Bot Orchestration**: Deploy and manage multiple instances of Hummingbot
- **Strategy Backtesting and Optimization**: Evaluate the performance of your strategies against historical data and optimize them with Optuna
- **One-Click Deployment**: Seamlessly deploy your strategies as Hummingbot instances for paper or live trading.
- **Performance Analysis Monitoring**: Monitor and analyze the performance of your deployed strategies.
- **Credential Management**: Create and manage separate accounts for API keys

For detailed instructions and further information, visit our [documentation page](https://hummingbot.org/dashboard/).

## Installation

Currently, we recommend users to install Dashboard using the **[Deploy repo](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy)** instead as this will automatically launch Dashboard along with the needed components in their own Docker containers. 

If you are a developer, and want to make changes to the code then we recommend using the Source installation below - please note that you will also need to launch the Backend API and Broker separately (either through source install or through Docker).   

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Docker Engine
   - Miniconda or Anaconda

2. **Clone Repository and Navigate to Directory**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard.git
    cd dashboard
    ```

3. **Create Conda Environment and Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

4. **Activate the Isolated 'conda' Environment**:
    ```bash
    conda activate dashboard
    ```

5. **Start the Dashboard**:
    ```bash
    make run
    ```

For more detailed instructions on how to install and update the dashboard, refer to [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).


## Authentication

Authentication is disabled by default. To enable Dashboard Authentication please follow the steps below: 

**Set Credentials (Optional):**

The dashboard uses `admin` and `abc` as the default username and password respectively. It's strongly recommended to change these credentials for enhanced security.:

- For Docker, navigate to the `deploy` folder or `dashboard` folder if using Source and open the `credentials.yml` file.
- Add or modify the current username / password and save the changes afterward
  
  ```
  credentials:
    usernames:
      admin:
        email: admin@gmail.com
        name: John Doe
        logged_in: False
        password: abc
  cookie:
    expiry_days: 0
    key: some_signature_key # Must be string
    name: some_cookie_name
  pre-authorized:
    emails:
    - admin@admin.com
  ```  

### Docker

- Ensure the dashboard container is not running.
- Open the `docker-compose.yml` file within the `deploy` folder using a text editor.
- Locate the environment variable `AUTH_SYSTEM_ENABLED` under the dashboard service configuration.
  
  ```
  services:
  dashboard:
    container_name: dashboard
    image: hummingbot/dashboard:latest
    ports:
      - "8501:8501"
    environment:
        - AUTH_SYSTEM_ENABLED=True
        - BACKEND_API_HOST=backend-api
        - BACKEND_API_PORT=8000
  ```
- Change the value of `AUTH_SYSTEM_ENABLED` from `False` to `True`.
- Save the changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- Relaunch Dashboard by running `bash setup.sh`
  
### Source 

- Open the `CONFIG.py` file located in the dashboard root folder
- Locate the line `AUTH_SYSTEM_ENABLED = os.getenv("AUTH_SYSTEM_ENABLED", "False").lower() in ("true", "1", "t")`.
  
  ```
  CERTIFIED_EXCHANGES = ["ascendex", "binance", "bybit", "gate.io", "hitbtc", "huobi", "kucoin", "okx", "gateway"]
  CERTIFIED_STRATEGIES = ["xemm", "cross exchange market making", "pmm", "pure market making"]
  
  AUTH_SYSTEM_ENABLED = os.getenv("AUTH_SYSTEM_ENABLED", "False").lower() in ("true", "1", "t")
  
  BACKEND_API_HOST = os.getenv("BACKEND_API_HOST", "127.0.0.1")
  ```
- Change the value from `False` to `True` to enable dashboard authentication.
- Save the CONFIG.py file.
- Relaunch dashboard by running `make run`
